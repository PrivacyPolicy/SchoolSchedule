# SchoolSchedule
Calculates all schedules that fit certain criteria

I created this to specifically accomodate my own classes and schedule, so it does not contain some important features such as a large range of time or fancy functionality.


TODO:
- Provide fancier interface to be more user-friendly for the engineers
- Save the data to avoid requiring the user to re-enter all the time
- Allow easier input of time data... because military-time text-input sucks
- Auto-scrape data from CAMS, because this is made for the Poly students
